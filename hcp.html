<p id="in"><b>For frying potatoes</b></p>  
<p id="sub">Peel the potatoes and chop them like french fries and wash them in salt water to remove starch.<br>
    Then take riceflour and add a bit of salt and add potatoes to it. Toss the potatoes in the rice flour so that it gets evenly covered in rice flour.<br>
    Now in hot oil fry your potatoes till they turn golden brown. Put them in a plate to cool down.
</p> 
<p id="in"><b>For sauce</b></p>
<p id="sub">
    Take about 2 spoons of the tomato ketchup and add finely chopped garlic, chilly powder. Mix them into a watery paste consistency.
</p>
<p id="sub">
    In a pan put 2 spoon oil and heat it.Then add onions and saute it till its half cooked. Then add tomatoes, our garlic 
    <br>sauce and a bit of salt saute it till tomatoes are half cooked(we want that crunch). Then turn off the stove.<br>
    Now add fried potatoes and honey and mix it till the sauce is fully covered. Add coriander leaver for garnishing if you want.
