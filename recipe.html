<p id="in"><b>For dough</b></p>  
<p id="sub">Take flour and add salt.Then add hot oil and just work the dough.Then add water as required and knead for about 5 to 6 minutes 
    <br>and let the dough rest for about 20 minutes
</p> 
<p id="in"><b>For stuffing</b></p>
<p id="sub">
    In a pan put 1 to 2 spoon oil and heat it.Then add garlic and saute it till it turns slightly brown.Then add onions and saute it <br>
    for a while till onion is half cooked.Then add all your vegetables,soy sauce and black pepper.Add salt only if you want<br>
    since soy sauce is already present.Then let the stuffing be cooled for a while.

</p>
<p id="sub">
    Now take your dough and start making small balls out of them.Roll them into a cirle of about 3 to 4 cm radius and put your stuffing <br>
    in there.Then seal your momo however you want by rubbing water to edges of your cirle.<br>
    Then put your momos directly in boiling water or in a steaming pot. It takes about 15 to 20 min for cooking since our veggies are already cooked.
